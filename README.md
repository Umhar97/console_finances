# Console Finances

I was tasked with creating code that would analyse the financial records of a company.

My tasks included calculating:
1. The total number of months included in the dataset.
2. The net toal amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
3. The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
4. The greatest increase in profits over the entire period (including the date and amount).
5. The greatest decrease in profits over the entire period (including the date and amount).
